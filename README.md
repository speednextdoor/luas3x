# luas3x

inline cannot stop you; shuffles cannot stop you. luas3x will LET you do **ANYTHING** you want.

this repo contains some of the luau functions from roblox. it is *not* all of them. comments are made.

# how to use?

do not just copy paste the code into a new header, i suggest dragging the folder into your project, and then going from there.
